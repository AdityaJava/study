üß† Core Java & OOP Fundamentals
Q: What Java features should I master?
A: You should be proficient with Java 8‚Äì17+. This includes lambdas, Streams API, Optional, CompletableFuture for async tasks, var for type inference, and Records for concise data classes. Also, know how modules work (JPMS from Java 9) and be comfortable with pattern matching, sealed classes, and text blocks from later versions.

Q: How important is understanding concurrency?
A: It's essential. You need to master Thread, Runnable, ExecutorService, ForkJoinPool, thread-safety (synchronized, ReentrantLock), atomic operations (AtomicInteger, etc.), and concurrency utilities like CountDownLatch, Semaphore, and ConcurrentHashMap. Also understand race conditions, deadlocks, and safe publication.

Q: What principles guide good object-oriented design?
A: Follow SOLID principles, especially:

S: Single Responsibility
O: Open/Closed
L: Liskov Substitution
I: Interface Segregation
D: Dependency Inversion
Use design patterns (Factory, Builder, Strategy, Proxy), write clean, testable code, and ensure strong encapsulation.

üîß Spring Boot
Q: What should I know about Spring Boot internals?
A: Understand how autoconfiguration works using @Conditional* annotations and how starter dependencies auto-wire beans. Customize Spring Boot's behavior using application.yml and override defaults when necessary. Know how the application context is initialized and how embedded servers (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.) are managed.

Q: How should I handle different environments?
A: Use Spring Profiles and environment-specific configs (application-dev.yml, etc.). Activate them using JVM arguments or environment variables. You can also externalize configs using Spring Cloud Config, Vault, or Kubernetes Secrets.

üß© Spring Core & DI
Q: What are bean scopes and lifecycle hooks?
A: Key scopes include:

Singleton (default)
Prototype
Request
Session
Use @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy for lifecycle callbacks. Also, be aware of InitializingBean, DisposableBean, and BeanPostProcessor for deeper customization.

Q: How do I manage conditional bean loading?
A: Use annotations like @ConditionalOnMissingBean, @ConditionalOnProperty, and custom Condition classes to enable/disable beans based on config or classpath presence.

üåê Spring MVC / REST APIs
Q: How should I build REST APIs?
A: Follow REST principles:

Proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
Status codes
Stateless interactions
Use @Valid and validation annotations for input. Handle exceptions using @ControllerAdvice.

Q: What advanced features should I know?
A: Use:

Interceptors
Filters
Content negotiation
Custom HandlerMethodArgumentResolver
Integrate with Swagger/OpenAPI and apply pagination and HATEOAS if needed.

üßµ Spring AOP
Q: When and how to use Spring AOP?
A: For cross-cutting concerns like:

Logging
Security
Caching
Auditing
Use @Aspect, @Around, @Before, @AfterReturning, etc. Understand proxy-based vs AspectJ-based weaving and self-invocation limitations.

üß¨ Spring Data JPA & Hibernate
Q: What should I know about entity mapping?
A: Master annotations like:

@OneToMany, @ManyToOne, @ManyToMany, @Embedded
Cascade types
Lazy vs Eager fetching
Understand orphan removal, bidirectional mapping, and entity lifecycle.

Q: How to optimize queries and performance?
A: Prevent N+1 issues using fetch joins or EntityGraph. Write custom JPQL/native queries when needed. Use second-level caching (e.g., with EhCache or Redis) and audit slow queries using Hibernate stats or p6spy.

üîÅ Transaction Management
Q: How does @Transactional work?
A: It manages transaction boundaries. Know:

Propagation levels (REQUIRED, REQUIRES_NEW, etc.)
Isolation levels (READ_COMMITTED, SERIALIZABLE, etc.)
Only unchecked exceptions trigger rollback by default
Also, remember self-invocation doesn't trigger proxies, so the annotation may not work inside the same class.

‚òÅÔ∏è Spring Cloud
Q: What components are essential?
A: Key components:

Eureka (Service Discovery)
Spring Cloud Config (centralized config)
Gateway (routing/filtering)
Feign (declarative REST client)
Resilience4j (resilience patterns)
Sleuth/Zipkin (tracing)

Q: How to handle distributed systems?
A: Use circuit breakers, retries, fallback mechanisms. Adopt event-driven patterns with Kafka/RabbitMQ. Add tracing headers across services for debugging.

üß† Redis Caching
Q: How to use Redis with Spring?
A: Use:

@Cacheable, @CachePut, @CacheEvict
Custom key generators
RedisTemplate for advanced operations
Handle TTLs and invalidation properly. Use serialization strategies like JSON or StringRedisSerializer.

Q: What Redis features are critical?
A: Know:

Redis data types (List, Hash, Set, Sorted Set)
Distributed locks (e.g., via Redisson)
Pub/Sub for invalidation
Strategies to avoid cache stampede/avalanche/penetration

üèóÔ∏è Database & Performance
Q: How to optimize DB interactions?
A: Use HikariCP. Optimize queries with proper indexing, batch operations, and query plans. Avoid unnecessary joins. Use connection pool monitoring and tune timeouts.

üîê Security
Q: How to secure applications?
A: Use Spring Security with:

JWT for stateless APIs
Role-based access control
OAuth2/OIDC (Keycloak, Okta)
CSRF protection, CORS configuration
Avoid exposing sensitive endpoints.

üß™ Testing
Q: What testing tools should I use?
A: Use:

JUnit 5
Mockito
@SpringBootTest, @DataJpaTest, @WebMvcTest
TestContainers for DB, Redis
RestAssured/Postman for API testing

üöÄ DevOps Awareness
Q: What should I know about deployments?
A: Containerize using Docker. Use Jib for fast image builds. Deploy with Helm charts and Kubernetes. Configure readiness/liveness probes. Monitor with Prometheus/Grafana. Log aggregation using ELK or Loki.

üìà Observability
Q: How to make apps observable?
A: Use:

Spring Boot Actuator
Sleuth or OpenTelemetry for tracing
Micrometer for metrics
Prometheus/Grafana for visualization
Correlate logs with trace IDs for distributed requests

üèõÔ∏è Architecture & Design
Q: What architecture patterns should I follow?
A: Apply:

Domain Driven Design (Entities, Aggregates, Value Objects)
Event-driven architecture
Saga pattern for distributed transactions
Microservices vs Monolith tradeoffs

Q: How to manage service boundaries?
A: Use database-per-service when possible. Prevent tight coupling. Implement anti-corruption layers. Apply appropriate caching strategies (read-through, write-through, write-behind).

üí¨ Soft Skills & Code Practices
Q: What soft skills are essential?
A: Write design documents, perform code reviews, mentor juniors, break down complex problems, communicate clearly with stakeholders, and contribute to planning and delivery estimations.
