Illustration:
HashMap Structure:

rust
Copy code
HashMap
├── Bucket 0 -> [key1 -> value1, key2 -> value2]  (in case of collision)
├── Bucket 1 -> [key3 -> value3]
└── Bucket 2 -> [key4 -> value4]
The order of the elements in the HashMap is not preserved.

LinkedHashMap Structure:

rust
Copy code
LinkedHashMap
├── Bucket 0 -> [key1 -> value1, key2 -> value2]
├── Bucket 1 -> [key3 -> value3]
├── Bucket 2 -> [key4 -> value4]
└── Linked List -> [key1 -> key2 -> key3 -> key4]  (preserves insertion order)

In short, HashMap uses linked lists only for handling hash collisions, whereas LinkedHashMap uses a linked list to maintain the order of elements.
